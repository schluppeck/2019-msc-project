# Ideas

Some ideas for specific questions we can start attacking. In no particular order - you'd also have to think about how/what, subordinate aims, ways to quantify, etc.:

- register the MRA into standard space (MNI)?
    - how? what commands? FSL registration? how do we know it worked?


- compare measurements in our MRA with those derived from atlas
    - how to segment into different parts / corresponding to big vessels
- comparing LEFT / RIGHT (symmetry present)
- how to improve images of what we have (smoothing?)
